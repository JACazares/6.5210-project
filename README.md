# 6.5210-project

This is the repository where we can combine the different algorithms used for the Convex Hull 6.5210 project, by Jose Angel Cazares Torres, Nikoloz Birkadze and Tasmeem Reza.

Just a brief overview:
Tests/test.cpp, has the main(), I was planning on actually running/comparing the code from there

Algorithms/[folder]/[file.h], header files that will be imported by Tests/test.cpp to actually run the algorithms.

A note on convention: the functions should get a vector of Point<double> and return a vector of Point<double>, the CH in ccw order, beginning from the leftmost point
